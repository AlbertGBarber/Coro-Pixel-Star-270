# Coro-Pixel-Star-270
 Boscoyo 270 Node Star Code and Info.
 
 For Video See:
 
 Not doing a full write-up and how-to for this, because I made it several years ago. 
 Overall, it is not too complicated. The images should give you enough hints on how to build it.
 
 Basic contruction details:
 *Spray paint star desired color.
 
 *Insert pixels into star so that they start in center and circle outwards (forming complete stars). Add power injection points every 70 pixels or so.
 
 *Put power supply in electronics box with Arduino on mini-breadboard. 
 
 *Add wires in/out using water proof connectors, cable glands, and crimp connectors, etc.
 
 *Attach electronics box to star using standoffs to rise above pixels. 
 
 *Ignore the tube coming from the top of the box in the pictures, it is for a light sensor.
